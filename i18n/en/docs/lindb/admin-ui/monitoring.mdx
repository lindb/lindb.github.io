## Dashboard

Dashboard is a self-monitoring page that comes with LinDB, the internal real-time status of each component is available
in the relevant dashboards

For specific metric descriptions, refer to [Self-monitoring](../self-monitor)

## Replication

Database replication status mainly includes the following status:

- Basic state information of the database, such as the number of replicas;
- Replica distribution and replication status, such as channels delay information;
- Local replication write.

### WAL

There are 2 modes viewing replica status, which can be switched through the button on the right side
of the Replication State:

- Mode 1: Perspective of the distribution of replicas in each Storage node, and show whether there is a
  replication delay, mouse hover to a shard will display replication of each channel in it;

![replication shards](/img/lindb/guide/admin_ui/replication_shards.png)

- Mode 2: Perspective of replication channels under all shards, Shard/Family related filtering and filtering is
  supported

![replication families](/img/lindb/guide/admin_ui/replication_families.png)

### Write

Write status of the local replica:

- Write status of each memory-database;
- Each `leader`'s writing pointer status;

- Mode 1: Perspective of writing status of all memory databases under all shards,
  Shard/Family related filtering and filtering is supported

![memory database write](/img/lindb/guide/admin_ui/memory_database_write.png)

- Mode 2: Perspective of all active families under all shards,
  Shard/Family related filtering and filtering is supported

## Request

Browse for [LinQL](../lin-ql) that is currently executing in the cluster

![memory database replica](/img/lindb/guide/admin_ui/request_list.png)

## Log View

Log View allows users to browse log files on all nodes in the cluster and displays related logs.
