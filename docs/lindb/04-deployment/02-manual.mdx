  Guide showing how to deploy LinDB on servers.
---

LinDB provides three modes:

|Mode|Env|
|:---------------|:---|
|[Standalone](#standalone-mode)|test/dev|
|[Cluster](#cluster-mode)|production|
|[Multiple IDCs/Regions](#multiple-idcs/regions-mode)|production|

## Standalone Mode

This mode integrates broker/storage/ETCD and other components into a single process to achieve rapid and simple
deployment.

Applicable scenario: Quickly deploy LinDB test cluster using MacOS or stand-alone Linux environment to experience the
basic functions of LinDB cluster.

1. Download latest version at [LinDB version release address](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/releases);
2. Quick start;

   Use the following command to experience the standalone mode with default configuration,
   you can also quickly generate the default configuration file and adjust the corresponding
   parameters. [For more parameters, refer to](/docs/lindb/reference/configuration#standalone).

```sh
./lind standalone run
```

```sh
./lind standalone -h
Run as a standalone node with embed broker, storage, etcd)

Usage:
  lind standalone [command]

Available Commands:
  init-config create a new default standalone-config
  run         run as standalone mode

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for standalone

Use "lind standalone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

3. Aceess LinDB Admin Console at [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000) to view the overall status.
   [For more Admin Console, refer to](/docs/lindb/admin-console/index);

4. At the same time, you can also query the status and data in the cluster through Lin
   Cli. [For more Cli, please refer to](/docs/lindb/client/cli);

## Cluster Mode

This mode requires independent deployment of LinDB components.

Applicable scenario: production environment.

> [!tip]
> The following example use the minimum nodes of LinDB cluster to illustrate the LinDB's deployment of cluster mode.
>
> For actual business scenarios, please picks the cluster size according to specific requirements.
>
> IP in the following example is for reference only.

This example takes three hosts as an example. Each host is deployed with three broker/storage/ETCD components.

The host IP are as follows:

- 192.168.1.10
- 192.168.1.11
- 192.168.1.12

The component deployment order is ETCD/Broker/Storage. The component information is as follows:
|Components | Configuration|
| ---- | --- |
|ETCD | Default port<br/>Default configuration|
|Broker | Default port<br/>Default configuration|
|Storage | Default port<br/>Adjust the node IDs, and use the default configuration for others|

**1. Deploy ETCD，[For more ETCD details, refer to](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/)**

**2. Deploy Broker.**

```sh
$ bin/lind broker
Run as a compute node with cluster mode enabled

Usage:
  lind broker [command]

Available Commands:
  init-config create a new default broker-config
  run         starts the broker

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for broker

Use "lind broker [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

- [Download Default Config](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/blob/main/config/broker.toml.example). Or you can generate a
  new config example by next command.

```sh
$ lind broker init-config
```

- Edit config，such as ETCD address and others according to the actual scenario.

```toml
[coordinator]
## ETCD register namespace
namespace = "/lindb-broker"
## ETCD address
endpoints = ["http://192.168.1.10:2379","http://192.168.1.11:2379","http://192.168.1.12:2379"]
.......
```

- Start Broker.

```shell
$ lind broker run --config=broker.toml
```

> [!tip]
> Generally, a VIP or LB may be placed in front of the broker to provide a unified entry address.

**3. Deploy Storage:**

```sh
$ bin/lind storage
Run as a storage node with cluster mode enabled

Usage:
  lind storage [command]

Available Commands:
  init-config create a new default storage-config
  run         starts the storage

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for storage

Use "lind storage [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

- [Download Default Config](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/blob/main/config/storage.toml.example). Or you can generate a
  new config example by next command.

```sh
$ lind storage init-config
```

- Edit config，such as ETCD address and Storage Node ID according to the actual scenario.

```toml
[storage]
## broker address for storage-cluster registration
broker-endpoint = "http://192.168.1.10:9000"
.......
[coordinator]
## ETCD register namespace
namespace = "/lindb-storage"
## ETCD address
endpoints = ["http://192.168.1.10:2379","http://192.168.1.11:2379","http://192.168.1.12:2379"]
.......

## Self-Monitor details
[monitor]
## Metric Report Address (Broker Write Endpoint)
url = "http://192.168.1.19:9000/api/flat/write?db=_internal"
```

- Start Storage.

```sh
$ lind storage run --config=storage.toml --myid=1
```

> [!warning]
> The value of **myid**  must be unique within the current storage cluster
> to indicate the uniqueness within the storage node cluster.
> 
> There are 2 ways to set myid:
> 
> - As above, you can add the **--myid=1** parameter to the start command. This method is used to set the default
>   value of myid. If this file already exists, the parameter does not take effect, otherwise this value will be persisted
>   into myid file;
> - Create or modify the value in the myid file under the data storage directory;
> 
> The design idea of myid is similar to that of zookeeper.

4. Access LinDB Admin Console at [http://192.168.1.10:9000](http://192.168.1.10:9000)
   The interface is used to view the overall status. [For more Admin Console, please refer to](/docs/lindb/admin-console/index);

5. At the same time, you can also query the status and data in the cluster through Lin
   Cli. [For more Cli, please refer to](/docs/lindb/client/cli);

## Multiple IDCs/Regions Mode

Compared with the cluster mode, the multiple IDCs/Regions mode has an additional `Root` cluster, which is used to query and aggregate data in each IDC/Region. 

The following mainly introduces the deployment of the `Root` cluster.

**1. Deploy ETCD，[For more ETCD details, refer to](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/)**

**2. Deploy Root.**

```sh
$ bin/lind root 
Run as a root compute node with multi idc/regions mode enabled

Usage:
  lind root [command]

Available Commands:
  init-config create a new default root-config
  run         starts the root

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for root

Use "lind root [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

- [Download Default Config](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/blob/main/config/root.toml.example). Or you can generate a
  new config example by next command.

```sh
$ lind root init-config
```

- Edit config，such as ETCD address and others according to the actual scenario.

```toml
[coordinator]
## ETCD register namespace
namespace = "/lindb-root"
## ETCD address
endpoints = ["http://192.168.1.10:2379","http://192.168.1.11:2379","http://192.168.1.12:2379"]
.......
```

- Start Root.

```sh
$ lind root run --config=root.toml
```

- Access LinDB Admin Console at [http://192.168.1.10:3000](http://192.168.1.10:3000)
   The interface is used to view the overall status. [For more Admin Console, please refer to](/docs/lindb/admin-console/index);
